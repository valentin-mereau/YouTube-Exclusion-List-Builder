## Demo
**The application is made of two tabs.**  
* The first tab is where you will upload the Excel file with the YouTube channels you want to check.
Please note that you need to use the template available 
[here](/template_excel_file.xlsx) 
for formatting purposes. Only `.xlsx` format can be uploaded on the application.

* On the second tab you need to enter your YouTube API token. If you don't know to get one you can click on `How to get a token ?`.
Instructions to get a token will be shown. Note that a token is limited to 10.000 requests per day. If you would like
to process more than 10.000 channels you will need to use multiple API token or wait the next day.

Once you enter a valid token and upload an Excel file matching the template, the application will show you
how many channels are in your file. Note that the button `Process channels` is now clickable to start the process.

As the application processes the channels, the time left will be displayed. At anytime during the process you can click 
on `Stop & Save`, it will interrupt the process and save the data collected in your file.

When the application is done, or you used `Stop & Save`, the data collected will be saved in your file on a new tab named
`Results`.

If you didn't process all the channels of your file because you reached the quota limitation of your token, or you used
`Stop & Save`, you can always upload again your file to process the remaining channels. The application will automatically
detect your `Results` tab and start from where you left.  
_You can see from the example of the demo that the channels to process went from 9.750 to 9.096 when I upload the file 
again._

**The results in your Excel file.**  

When the process is complete your data will be saved in the `Results` tab. Note that the number of channels in your `Data` 
tab and in the `Results` tab may be different. The application will automatically remove duplicate rows. You will see four 
new columns, `madeForKids` which indicates if the channel is made for kids or not. `Description` which contains the 
description of the channel. `Default Language`which is the main language used on the channel. `Topic` which describe the 
content type of the channel. You can now filter with any element you want and build your exclusion list.

The `Description` column is also useful when 'No data' appears in `madeForKids`. You can use the _Find & Replace_ Excel tool 
to search for keywords such as 'kids' or 'fairytale' and add the matching channels to your list.

## Upcoming updates
v2.0 [released]
* Additional filtering options such as language. [done - language and topic now available]
* Moving the application to a more general exclusion list builder. [done]
* Standalone executable for v2.0 [macOS done, Windows pending]

v2.1 [working in progress]
* Improve performance by using pandas' db feature to better manage the channels to process. [done - pandas appears to be 
heavy for the standalone executable. optimization have been done with another approach]
